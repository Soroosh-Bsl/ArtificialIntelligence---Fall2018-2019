# ArtificialIntelligence---Fall2018-2019
The Artificial Intelligence course @ Sharif University of Technology ---Fall2018-2019

Taught by: Prof. Mohammad Hossein Rohban

P1: Q1-> A board game was proposed and the students were asked to implement an A* algorithm + proposing and implementing suitable heuristic functions. 
    Q2-> Another complicated board game but this time the solution had to use Genetic algorithms. 
    
P2: Q1-> A constraint satisfaction problem based on professors' timetables and students' + prerequisities between courses.
    Q2-> A two-snake game implemented in Java was given to students to come up with an algorithm based on MinMax and AlphaBeta Pruning.
    
P3: Q1-> Naive Bayes implementation for MNIST dataset + Laplace Smoothing. Confusion Matrix was reported. A validation set was split for fine tuning the smoothing paprameters.
    Q2-> Logistic Regression on a Cancer dataset. Confusion Matrix was reported.
    Q3-> Decision Trees using sklearn on Cancer dataset.
    Q4-> Linear Regression on Bike dataset. Regularization term ||w||^2 (weight decay) was added. A validation split was used to search for the best regularization coefficient.
